- Redo whole soldier/squad selection cuz buggy behaviour
  - REMOVE IT AAAALLLLL

# Bugs
- Deleted squad can still get soldiers added => Racho's repo
- If you don't select the type of soldier class (e.g. Sniper 1, Sniper 2) it will only update the perk points if either add a new soldier, or switch between soldiers
- Renumber squads
- When deleting the selected squad, selected squad does not reflect and will pretend it still exists => signal doesnt update?!?!?!
- Update angular

# UI
- Redo soldiers
	- Left: icon and level
	- Center: (top to bottom): Perk Icon + number (coloured)
